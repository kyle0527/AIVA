# Troubleshooting Guides README

## üîß Contract System Problem Resolution

Troubleshooting guides focused on diagnosing and resolving issues related to AIVA's contract-driven architecture. These guides provide systematic approaches to identifying and fixing contract-related problems while maintaining system performance and integrity.

**Troubleshooting Philosophy**: Contract issues often manifest as performance degradation, validation failures, or cross-language compatibility problems. Quick diagnosis and resolution maintain AIVA's 6.7x performance advantage and system reliability.

## üìä Common Contract-Related Issues

Based on system analysis and monitoring data:

- **Contract Validation Failures**: Most common issue (schema mismatches, type errors)
- **Performance Degradation**: Contract serialization bottlenecks
- **Cross-Language Issues**: Multi-language contract binding problems
- **Database Health**: 0% database health requires immediate attention
- **Import/Schema Issues**: Development environment setup problems

## üìã Troubleshooting Process

### üéØ **Quick Diagnosis Checklist**

When encountering contract-related issues:

1. **Performance Issues**
   - [ ] Run performance benchmark to compare against 8,536 ops/s baseline
   - [ ] Check contract validation overhead in problematic operations
   - [ ] Validate JSON serialization performance vs alternatives

2. **Validation Failures**
   - [ ] Verify contract schema definitions are up-to-date
   - [ ] Check for circular imports in contract definitions
   - [ ] Validate data against contract requirements

3. **Cross-Language Issues**
   - [ ] Verify contract bindings exist for target languages
   - [ ] Test contract serialization/deserialization across languages
   - [ ] Check schema synchronization status

4. **Development Environment**
   - [ ] Verify aiva_common installation and import resolution
   - [ ] Check contract library dependencies
   - [ ] Validate development tool configuration

### üîç **Systematic Problem Resolution**

#### Step 1: Issue Classification
- **Performance**: Slow contract operations, serialization bottlenecks
- **Validation**: Schema validation failures, type mismatches
- **Integration**: Cross-language compatibility, import issues
- **Environment**: Development setup, dependency problems

#### Step 2: Data Collection
- Run contract completion analysis for system health overview
- Execute performance benchmarks for baseline comparison
- Collect error logs with contract validation details
- Document environment configuration and dependencies

#### Step 3: Resolution Strategy
- **Performance Issues**: Reference performance optimization guide
- **Schema Issues**: Follow forward reference repair procedures
- **Environment Issues**: Use development environment troubleshooting
- **Integration Issues**: Apply cross-language compatibility solutions

#### Step 4: Validation
